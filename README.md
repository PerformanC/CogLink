# Coglink

## About it

Coglink (not defined yet, name idea by `ap8650#5478`, AKA HackerSmacker), the firsts [Concord](https://github.com/Cogmasters/concord)'s specific lavalink wrapper, still trying to be low-level, where you are able to control a lot of things, and still with the amazing Concord's function design.

## Why?

Coglink provides simple, still really customizable, functions for you to control whatever you want, and still with ease.
Also uses a lot of Concord's pre-installed libraries, being considered fully standard (as you would need Concord in any type of way to run it).

## Performance

Even without proof, it's really fast, built with performance in mind, always. Any type of performance issue can be reported and will be fixed in the best way possible, but we aren't going to sacrifice stability to get more performance, don't worry.

## Status

Sadly, it's not recommended for production for now, in some days, it's expected to get more functions and better stability, for now, you can use it to have some fun, but **DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION**.

## Credits

This library wouldn't be possible without [Cogmaster](https://discord.gg/YcaK3puy49)'s guild members, they helped me all the way through, and special thanks to `müller#1001`, Concord's lead developer, without him, nothing of this would be possible, thank you! ❤️
